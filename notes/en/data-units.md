# Units of Data Measurement

## 1. Bit (bit)
- **Bit** is the basic unit of information.
- It can have values **0** or **1**.
  
## 2. Byte (Byte, B)
- **1 byte = 8 bits**.
- The byte is the smallest addressable unit of memory in a computer.

## 3. Kilobyte (Kilobyte, KB)
- **1 KB = 1,000 bytes = 10³ bytes** (decimal system).
- Often used to measure the size of small files, such as text documents.

## 4. Megabyte (Megabyte, MB)
- **1 MB = 1,000,000 bytes = 10⁶ bytes**.
- Example: A high-quality photo may take between 1 to 5 megabytes.

## 5. Gigabyte (Gigabyte, GB)
- **1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes = 10⁹ bytes**.
- Example: A high-definition (HD) movie can take up several gigabytes.

## 6. Terabyte (Terabyte, TB)
- **1 TB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes = 10¹² bytes**.
- Example: Modern hard drives can have capacities ranging from 1 to 4 terabytes.

## 7. Petabyte (Petabyte, PB)
- **1 PB = 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes = 10¹⁵ bytes**.
- Example: The amount of data transferred over the internet in a few days can be measured in petabytes.

## Alternative (Binary) System
Sometimes the binary system is used for more precise definitions:

- **1 Kibibyte (KiB) = 2¹⁰ bytes = 1024 bytes**.
- **1 Mebibyte (MiB) = 2²⁰ bytes = 1,048,576 bytes**.
- **1 Gibibyte (GiB) = 2³⁰ bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes**.
- **1 Tebibyte (TiB) = 2⁴⁰ bytes = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes**.

### Notes:
- The decimal system is more commonly used for larger data measurements, although the binary system is sometimes applied to RAM.
